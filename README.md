ðŸŽ® GameMate - Personalized Game Recommendation System
GameMate is a user-centric mobile and web application designed to provide personalized game recommendations based on user interactions and preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques, powered by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to recommend games that align with a user's unique tastes.

This repository contains the implementation of the recommendation system, along with a Gradio-based user interface for seamless interaction.
